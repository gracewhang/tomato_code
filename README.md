# tomato_code
This is an image processing matlab script which works for .jpg files.

The code will first convert image to grayscale and then threshold images at three varying levels. 

This is the first version, so it's quite sloppy if I'm being honest. 
For v2, I'd like to make it run more efficiently and give the user the ability to designate how many different grayscale values they want in the image.

I have attached the tomato.jpg as a test image as well. Enjoy!

xoxo,
